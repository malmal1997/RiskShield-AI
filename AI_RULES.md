This document outlines the rules and guidelines for the AI system's operation, particularly in the context of risk assessment and policy generation.

## Core Principles

1.  **Accuracy and Verifiability:** All AI-generated information, especially risk assessments and policy content, must be accurate and, where applicable, verifiable against source documents.
2.  **Transparency:** The AI's reasoning and the sources of its information should be transparent and explainable to human users.
3.  **Bias Mitigation:** The AI system must be designed and continuously monitored to minimize bias in its analysis and recommendations.
4.  **Security and Privacy:** All data processed by the AI, especially sensitive client and vendor information, must adhere to the highest standards of security and privacy (e.g., encryption, access controls, data minimization).
5.  **Human Oversight:** AI outputs are intended to assist, not replace, human judgment. Critical decisions must always involve human review and approval.
6.  **Continuous Improvement:** The AI models and rules should be regularly updated and refined based on performance, feedback, and evolving industry standards.

## Risk Assessment Rules

1.  **Evidence-Based Answers:** For any non-conservative answer (e.g., "Yes" to a security control, a high compliance rating), the AI MUST provide direct, verifiable evidence (e.g., a direct quote, page number, document name) from the uploaded documents.
    *   **Lack of Evidence:** If direct, verifiable evidence for a non-conservative answer is not found, the AI MUST default to the most conservative answer (e.g., "No", "Untested", lowest frequency option).
2.  **Confidence Scoring:** Each AI-generated answer must be accompanied by a confidence score (0.0-1.0) reflecting the certainty of the answer based on the evidence.
3.  **Anti-Hallucination:** The AI must be strictly prevented from generating information that is not present in the provided documents. If information is missing, it should state so explicitly.
4.  **Contextual Understanding:** The AI must understand the context of the questions and documents (e.g., "cybersecurity policy" vs. "HR policy") to ensure relevant analysis.
5.  **Risk Level Calculation:** The AI will contribute to a quantitative risk score (0-100) and qualitative risk level (Low, Medium, High, Critical) based on a predefined weighting of questions and answers.
6.  **Actionable Recommendations:** For identified risks or gaps, the AI should suggest clear, actionable recommendations for mitigation.
7.  **Document Citation:** All excerpts and evidence must be properly cited with document name, page/section number (if applicable), and document label (e.g., "Primary", "4th Party").

## Policy Generation Rules

1.  **Template Adherence:** AI-generated policies must adhere to the structure and core requirements of the selected policy template (e.g., Cybersecurity Policy, Data Privacy Policy).
2.  **Customization:** The AI must incorporate user-provided details (e.g., company name, institution type, employee count) into the policy content.
3.  **Regulatory Alignment:** Policies should reflect best practices and common regulatory requirements for the specified industry/institution type.
4.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Policy language should be clear, unambiguous, and easy for a non-expert to understand.
5.  **Version Control:** Each generated policy must be assigned a version number and tracked for changes.
6.  **Disclaimer:** All AI-generated policies must include a prominent disclaimer advising human review and legal counsel.

## Data Handling Rules

1.  **Data Minimization:** Only necessary data for assessment and policy generation should be collected and processed.
2.  **Encryption:** All sensitive data (e.g., uploaded documents, assessment responses) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
3.  **Access Control:** Access to raw data and AI models is strictly controlled and logged.
4.  **Retention:** Data retention policies must be clearly defined and adhered to.
5.  **Audit Trails:** All AI interactions, data access, and significant system events must be logged for audit purposes.

## Continuous Monitoring and Auditing

1.  **Performance Monitoring:** AI model performance (accuracy, speed, hallucination rate) must be continuously monitored.
2.  **Regular Audits:** The AI system, its rules, and its outputs must undergo regular internal and external audits for compliance and effectiveness.
3.  **Feedback Loop:** A mechanism for user feedback on AI outputs must be in place to facilitate continuous improvement.
