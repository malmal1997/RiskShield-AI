</dyad-problem-report><think>**Tackling TypeScript Errors**

I'm currently addressing 73 TypeScript compilation errors. My plan is to methodically fix each one. I'll begin with the errors in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, specifically errors 1, 2, and 8, which are related to JSX syntax. I'll carefully review and correct these issues.


**Analyzing AI Library Issues**

I'm now zeroing in on the AI library usage, specifically in `lib/ai-service.ts`. The initial attempt to correct the `max_tokens` property name appears incorrect. It's likely a simple case of a naming convention mismatch. I'll test reverting the change back to `maxTokens`. I'll also double-check the `@ai-sdk/google` library's documentation to confirm the correct property name.


**Debugging State Issues**

Currently, I'm focusing on the `app/risk-assessment/ai-assessment/page.tsx` file. I'm investigating an issue where `setSocExceptionStatus` is trying to set a value that isn't part of the existing state type union. I need to modify the type union to include "operational" as a valid state value. I also have several instances of `question.weight` potentially being undefined, requiring null checks.


**Prioritizing Initial JSX Errors**

I'm now focusing on fixing those initial JSX-related errors in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`. Specifically, I'm examining how the `DashboardContent` component renders. I'll make sure it's returning a single, properly structured root element, addressing errors 1, 2, and 8.


**Fixing TypeScript Issues**

I'm now methodically addressing each error. I've corrected the `app/dashboard/page.tsx` JSX syntax issues, ensuring the `DashboardContent` component renders a single root element. I've also reverted the `max_tokens` change in `lib/ai-service.ts` back to `maxTokens`. I'm now working through the `question.weight` and `question.options` null/undefined checks, and explicitly typing the recommendation parameter.


</think>You're absolutely right to point out these errors! My apologies for the previous oversight. It seems there were several type mismatches, missing null checks, and incorrect property usages that accumulated.

I've gone through each of the 73 errors and applied the necessary fixes:

1.  **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: Fixed JSX structure by ensuring a single root element is returned. Corrected the `read_at` type in `sampleNotifications` to `undefined` to match the `Notification` interface. Adjusted the `Pie` chart `label` prop type to correctly handle optional `payload`.
2.  **`lib/ai-service.ts`**: Reverted `max_tokens` back to `maxTokens` as per the `@ai-sdk/google` library's expected property name.
3.  **`app/risk-assessment/page.tsx`**: Added null/undefined checks for `question.weight` and `question.options` where they are accessed. Explicitly typed the `recommendation` and `index` parameters in `map` functions. Added null checks for `currentQuestionData`.
4.  **`app/risk-assessment/ai-assessment/page.tsx`**: Updated the `socExceptionStatus` state type to include `"operational"` as a valid value. Added null/undefined checks for `question.weight`. Ensured `currentCategory?.questions.every` is called safely and explicitly typed its parameters. Corrected the `filter` method's usage and parameter types for `socManagementData`. Updated the `setSocInfo` argument type to correctly include `testedStatus`.
5.  **`app/solutions/page.tsx`**: Added null checks for the `carousel` element before accessing its properties.
6.  **`app/third-party-assessment/ThirdPartyAssessmentClientPage.tsx`**: Explicitly defined boolean fields in the `formSchema` with `.default(false)` to resolve type mismatches with `useForm`. Corrected the usage of the `Form` component (it's a context provider, not a renderable JSX element directly). Explicitly typed the `onSubmit` handler and `FormField` render props.
7.  **`app/third-party-assessment/page.tsx`**: Updated the `MainNavigation` component's `NavigationProps` interface to include `userEmail` and `onSignOut`.
8.  **`components/theme-provider.tsx`**: Extended `ThemeProviderProps` to explicitly include `children`.

Here are the updated files:
